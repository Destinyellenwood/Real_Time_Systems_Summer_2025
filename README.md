## 📁 Repository Overview

This repository contains my projects and applications developed for the Real-Time Systems course, using the **ESP32 microcontroller** and **FreeRTOS** for cooperative multitasking.

Each folder represents a standalone application with source code, simulation files, and documentation.

---

## 🔗 Applications

| Week | Title & Theme | Folder | Description |
|------|----------------|--------|-------------|
| ✅ 1  | [Application 1 – Satellite Beacon & Telemetry](./Application1/) | `Application1/` | Simulates a satellite with a 2 Hz beacon LED and 10-second telemetry logging task. Bonus features include timing logs and task structuring. |
| ⏳ 2+ | Coming Soon    | `Application2/`, etc. | Future labs will include task scheduling, input handling, synchronization, and timing constraints. |

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **ESP32** (ESP-IDF)
- **FreeRTOS** (Task creation, scheduling, `vTaskDelay`)
- **Wokwi** Simulator (visualize timing, LED, and serial output)
- **PlatformIO** (local development in VSCode)

---

## 🧪 Running Projects in Wokwi

Each application includes:
- A `main.c` file with FreeRTOS tasks
- A `diagram.json` defining the hardware layout
- An optional `wokwi.toml` for simulation config

You can open any folder in Wokwi by copying the files into a new project.

> Example: [Run Application 1 in Wokwi](./Application1/README.md)
